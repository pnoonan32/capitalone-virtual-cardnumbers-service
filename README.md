## Installation

Choose one of the following options:

* Install with npm: `npm install iconic-narada`
* To install Iconic Narada from source, first clone the repository and then run: `npm install`.

### Edit config

In app root directory, rename `.sample-env` to `.env`. You can set app wide environment constants here and access them in your code with `dotenv` module and `process.env`.

In each example bot directory, you will find `config.json`. You can set bot specific constants here and access them by importing this file into your bot code. You may also instead retrieve this information from database for additional security.

### Enable/Disable a Platform

Each platform has it's own router, controller, parser, elements and connector. The main router in `routes.js` hands over new received event to the router of specific platform.

To enable a new platform, import the platform from platforms folder and create a new route for that platform in the main router(routes.js). E.g.: The below code will create a route like - https://your.domain/webhook/facebook

    import facebookRouter from './platforms/facebook/router';

    app.use('/facebook', facebookRouter);

### Run

To start the app without [babel](https://babeljs.io/), run `node app.js`.

To start the app with [babel](https://babeljs.io/), run `node start.js`

## Basic Usage

The business logic of bot is handled in `bots`. Each platform can have it's own configuration which may also be retrieved from database or environment file.

Once a platform is enabled by adding it to routes, the platform specific Controller in `platforms/<platform>/controller.js` parses every new event and hands over the parsed event to `bots/<platform>/index.js`. You can either process the parsed event here or create multiple bots for that platform and redirect the parsed event to respective bot. 

Bots can use Elements from `platforms/<platform>/elements.js` to create JSON objects to form a reply or action and, use Connector from `platforms/<platform>/connector.js` to send the reply or action to platform APIs.

Here are some examples of typical usage:

### Facebook Elements and Connector

#### Importing elements and connector

    import FacebookConnector from '../../../platforms/facebook/connector';
    import * as FacebookElements from '../../../platforms/facebook/elements';

#### Creating a message

Create a plain text message.

    const message = new FacebookElements.Text(`Hello there!`);

For more detailed samples of Facebook Elements, check out [this doc](https://github.com/iconicbot/iconic-narada/docs/Facebook.md).

#### Sending a message

Set the Recipient ID.

Event object contains basic information like senderId, recipientId, etc based on the type of event received.

    const recipientId = event.senderId;

Set a message.

    const message = new FacebookElements.Text(`Hello there!`);

Set the array of replies to be sent.

Reply element method requires a recipient ID and a message. It also accepts a string in place of message object.

    const replies = [
        new FacebookElements.Reply(recipientId, message),
        new FacebookElements.Reply(recipientId, 'What\'s up?'),
    ];

Send each reply in sequence.

    const facebookConnector = new FacebookConnectorACCESS_TOKEN);

    for (const reply of replies) {
        await facebookConnector.sendMessage(botConfig.PAGE_ID, reply)
            .catch(err => logger.error(err));
    }

#### Sending an action.

You can also send an action with/without/before/after a Reply element.

    const replies = [
        new FacebookElements.MarkSeen(recipientId),
        new FacebookElements.TypingOn(recipientId),
        new FacebookElements.TypingOff(recipientId),
    ];

#### Getting user profile.

You can get user profile with getUserProfile method.

    const facebookConnector = new FacebookConnectorACCESS_TOKEN);
    
    const userProfile = await facebookConnector.getUserProfile(recipientId)
        .catch(err => logger.debug(err));

### Twitter Elements and Connector

#### Importing elements and connector

    import TwitterConnector from '../../../platforms/twitter/connector';
    import * as TwitterElements from '../../../platforms/twitter/elements';

#### Creating a message

Create a plain text message.

    const message = new TwitterElements.Text(`Hi there!`);

For more detailed samples of Twitter Elements, check out [this doc](https://github.com/iconicbot/iconic-narada/docs/Twitter.md).

#### Sending a message.

Set the Recipient ID.

Event object contains basic information like senderId, recipientId, etc based on the type of event received.

    const recipientId = event.senderId;

Set a message.

    const message = new TwitterElements.Text(`Hello there!`);

Create an array of replies to be sent.

Reply element method requires a recipient ID and a message. It also accepts a string in place of message object.

    const replies = [
        new TwitterElements.Reply(recipientId, message),
        new TwitterElements.Reply(recipientId, 'What\'s up?'),
    ];

Send each reply in sequence.

    const twitterConnector = new TwitterConnectorOAUTH);

    for (const reply of replies) {
        await twitterConnector.sendMessage(reply)
          .catch(err => logger.error(err));
    }
